#    bl-install: a wrapper round the promptInstall() function in bl-includes
#    It may be called by other scripts or menus
#    to install Debian packages in a popup terminal window.
#    ( It is not needed in a script known to be running in a terminal;
#     in that case, just use promptInstall() )

HELP='bl-install: a wrapper round the promptInstall() function in bl-includes

Usage:
bl-install -n "name of app(s)" -m "message text" -f "/path/to/file" package [package...]

    -h --help                   show this message and exit
    -n --name       <string>    descriptive name of package(s) to be installed
    -m --message    <string>    message to display to user before installing
    -f --file       <filepath>  file to hold return value of script on exit

Specified options may be provided in any order.
If -n, -m or -f are used, they must be followed by an argument.
If -n or -m are absent they will be generated automatically.
If -f is set, the script will write its exit return value there,
so a calling script can test for success.
All other arguments are taken as package names to install.

This script will open a new terminal window to run the installer,
and fetch the return value from a temporary file.
This is useful if launching from a GUI, but in a script known to be
already running in a terminal, it is not needed.
The promptInstall() function from bl-includes is enough.
